This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories. The dataset undergoes preprocessing by normalizing pixel values and applying data augmentation techniques like rotation, shifting, and zooming to improve the model's robustness. The model is then trained and evaluated on the dataset, providing test accuracy and loss metrics.
